# Accounting-Ledger-Application


In my accounting ledger project, I developed an application using java to manage payments and deposit 
transactions.The project featured a Class named Transactions that handles transactions helping organize
data. I implemented BufferedReaders and FileReaders for efficient file input,along with bufferedWriters
for output. I created three screens that were required by the capstone but also help improve the users 
experience. Throughout my project I focused on encapsulating functionality into methods to improve maintainability
and readability. This approach cleaned up my code and also helped me grow by become a less repetitive coder.
